## localStorage Implementation Details

### How It Works
1. **Immediate Save**: When a theme is changed, it's instantly saved to localStorage
2. **Automatic Restore**: On page load, the saved theme is automatically restored
3. **Fallback Chain**: localStorage → System Preference → Default Theme
4. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles localStorage access issues

### Configuration
```javascript
WebsiteThemeSwitcher.init({
  storageKey: 'my-app-theme',        // Custom localStorage key
  defaultTheme: 'light',             // Fallback theme
  enableSystemPreference: true,      // Use OS preference as fallback
  onThemeChange: (theme) => {        // Callback when theme changes
    console.log('Theme saved to localStorage:', theme);
  }
});
```

### Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome**: Full localStorage support
- **Firefox**: Full localStorage support
- **Safari**: Full localStorage support
- **Edge**: Full localStorage support
- **IE 11**: Limited support (with polyfills)
